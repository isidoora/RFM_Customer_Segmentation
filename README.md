### Data Preprocessing
Before importing the data into MySQL for analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and consistency. The following steps were performed using Excel:

1. ***Data Cleaning***: Removed duplicate entries, corrected formatting inconsistencies, and addressed missing values.

2. ***Data Transformation***: Converted data types, standardized formats and applied necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

3. ***Data Validation***: Checked for outliers, anomalies, or inconsistencies in the data, and resolved any issues to ensure data integrity.

These preprocessing steps helped improve the quality and reliability of the dataset before conducting the analysis.
